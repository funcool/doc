== Introduction

*funcool* is a growing collection of open source Clojure and ClojureScript libraries that
sares this principes:

- Good documentation.
- Clear state of development.
- Easy way to contribute.
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.

Clojure has a very good community and has very good libraries for do almost everything and majority
of them are not known, but also it has much more libraries that are undocumented, unmantained or with
very bad implementation.

*funcool* people try to maintain a little collection of libraries developed by ourselves and also
maintain a updated list of libraries that matches with our philosophy, making available a good
reference list of libraries.


== Who is responsible for it?

*funcool* is a little comunity managed by a little group of persons that loves functional
programming and good and well documented open source software.

You can contact us using *funcool* google groups: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/funcool
